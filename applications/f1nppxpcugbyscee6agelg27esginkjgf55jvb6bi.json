    "Brief history of your project and organization": "NASA MODIS North America Land Surface Temperature Dataset (2000-2024) Overview\nThis dataset is derived from NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite sensor, providing daily land surface temperature observations for North America (30째N-60째N, 125째W-65째W) from 2000 to present, with a 1km spatial resolution. It is widely used for climate research, agricultural monitoring, and disaster early warning systems.\n\nKey Features\nData Source: NASA Terra/Aqua satellites (MODIS official page)\n\nTemporal Coverage: 2000 to present (daily updates)\n\nGeographic Coverage: North America (USA, Canada, and parts of Mexico)\n\nData Format: HDF/EOS (scientific standard format)\n\nVariables: Land Surface Temperature (LST), quality control flags, etc.\n\nTotal Size: ~900TB (daytime data only)",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Content to be Stored Will Include:\n1. Raw HDF Files\n\nDaily temperature data files officially provided by MODIS (e.g., MOD11A1.006 product)\n\nExample filename: MOD11A1.A2024001.h08v04.006.2024003050241.hdf\n\n2. Preprocessed Index Files\n\nSpatiotemporal indexes (CSV/JSON format) for efficient retrieval\n\nMetadata (including acquisition time, orbit number, data quality score)\n\n3. Visualization Support Data (Optional)\n\nAnnual/monthly temperature averages in GeoTIFF format\n\nThumbnails (PNG) for quick preview",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe, Australia (continent)",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03540144 \nf03540147 \nf03540153 \nf03336023 \nf03340635 \nf03336022 \nf03298672\nf03298673\nf03308920\nf03308922\nf03308933",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
